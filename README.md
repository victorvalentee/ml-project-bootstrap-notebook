# Machine Learning Project Bootstrap Notebook

IMHO the image that sums up the simplest workflow of most ML projects is this: ![ML Prject Basic Workflow](https://d1ldz4te4covpm.cloudfront.net/graphics/9781788838290/graphics/171dfaaa-00a1-4a62-9dd4-786ed31b412f.png)

Each of this sequential steps will be represented as sections in a bootstrap notebook, for the users to insert their own code.

"Shortcuts" will be provided such as a list of the most common imports found in ml projects and a notebook structure designed to streamline and organize the whole process.

**This is a work in progress**. Feel free to suggest improvements, fixes and to use it as you wish.
